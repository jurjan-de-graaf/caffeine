# Caffeine for your machine
Simple python script for keeping your system awake by simulating a keyboard press at regular intervals.

## Requirements
From the project root, run the following:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install PyAutoGUI directly:
```bash
pip install pyautogui
```
## Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python caffeine.py
```
## Windows alternative using base python
When you can or do not want to install requirements and your machine runs on windows, we can run the caffeine2 script that only uses base python:
```bash
python caffeine2.py
```
